# Warning

Do not play this if not asked to...

The new format of using local registry for almost all the training images should ensure we do not reach limits anymore!

## Creating a new nginx image locally

In order to reduce the probability of reaching DockerHub rate limit with everyone pulling images at the same time I am asking you to play those files right now to ensure everyone has the base nginx image in its own cluster.
The objects will be explained later during the training.
