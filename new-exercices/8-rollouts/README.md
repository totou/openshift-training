# Rollouts

For simplicity this will be done in "default" project
```
oc project default
```

Update the version of your application and see how it behaves
Notice the difference between Deployment, DeploymentConfig, StatefulSet

Advanced/Bonus - if time permits:
- Add some pre/post step to your DeploymentConfig
- Fully customise your rollout (not just pre/post)
